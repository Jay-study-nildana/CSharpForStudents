# .NET Core 5.0 Project

Web API Controller project with simple logging in the controllers.

Note : This project uses an InMemory Database. So, you wont find any migrations here. No point in using EF core and related commands or packages.

# Some Notes

1. Look at file - TodoItemsController. It has a ton of comments related to logging.
1. Look at file - appsettings.json. That is where different logging levels are configured in a section called "Logging".
1. The logging output appears in the output window > Project Name.
