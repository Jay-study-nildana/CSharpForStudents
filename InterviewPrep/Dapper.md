# Understanding Dapper (.NET), ORMs, and Entity Framework

## What is an ORM?

**ORM** stands for **Object-Relational Mapper**. It's a programming technique that allows developers to interact with relational databases using object-oriented paradigms, rather than writing SQL queries directly. ORMs automate the translation between database tables and programming language objects, making it easier to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

### Key Benefits of ORMs

- **Productivity**: Less boilerplate code for database access.
- **Abstraction**: Work with objects instead of SQL queries.
- **Maintainability**: Cleaner and more manageable codebases.
- **Security**: Reduces risk of SQL injection when used properly.

## What is Dapper?

**Dapper** is a lightweight, open-source ORM for .NET. It was created by Stack Overflow developers to provide fast and simple data access while retaining the performance of raw ADO.NET. Unlike heavyweight ORMs, Dapper is a micro-ORM: it doesn't track changes to objects or generate SQL under the hood, but it does map query results to objects efficiently.

### How Dapper Works

- You write SQL queries manually.
- Dapper executes your SQL and maps the results to your .NET objects.
- Minimal overhead compared to full-featured ORMs.

Dapper is distributed as a NuGet package and works seamlessly with any .NET project.

## The Role of Dapper in ADO.NET

**ADO.NET** is the foundational data access technology in .NET, providing classes like `SqlConnection`, `SqlCommand`, and `SqlDataReader` for interacting with databases. Dapper builds on top of ADO.NET, wrapping its operations with extension methods for easier object mapping.

- **Without Dapper**: You manually create connections, commands, readers, and map results to objects.
- **With Dapper**: You use extension methods like `.Query<T>()`, and Dapper handles result mapping.

Dapper doesn't replace ADO.NET; it streamlines its usage, making data access code cleaner and more maintainable.

## Dapper vs Entity Framework: Compare and Contrast

| Feature                    | Dapper                                   | Entity Framework (EF Core)        |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Type**                   | Micro-ORM                                | Full-featured ORM                 |
| **SQL Handling**           | Manual (you write SQL)                   | Auto-generated (LINQ queries)     |
| **Performance**            | Extremely fast, minimal overhead         | Slower due to abstraction         |
| **Change Tracking**        | None                                     | Full change tracking              |
| **Migrations**             | Not supported                            | Supported                         |
| **Complex Mapping**        | Manual                                   | Automated                         |
| **Learning Curve**         | Low (if you know SQL)                    | Higher (concepts: DbContext, LINQ)|
| **Ideal Use Case**         | Performance-critical, simple operations  | Complex domain models, rapid dev   |

### Why Entity Framework is Often Better for First-Time Developers

- **Abstraction**: EF hides the complexities of SQL and database schema. You interact with objects and classes, not tables and columns.
- **Productivity**: You can quickly scaffold models, perform queries using LINQ, and let EF handle the mapping and database interactions.
- **Migrations**: EF allows you to evolve your database schema alongside your codebase using code-based migrations.
- **Change Tracking**: EF tracks changes to your objects, so you don't have to manually manage updates and inserts.
- **Community Support**: EF is widely used, well-documented, and supported by Microsoft.

#### When to Prefer Dapper

- You need maximum performance and minimal overhead.
- You want precise control over SQL.
- Your data access needs are simple.
- You donâ€™t need migrations or change tracking.

## Summary

- **ORMs** allow you to work with databases in an object-oriented way.
- **Dapper** is a micro-ORM for .NET that makes ADO.NET easier and faster, but you must write SQL yourself.
- **Entity Framework** is a full ORM that abstracts database access and is a better fit for beginners due to its productivity features and abstraction.
