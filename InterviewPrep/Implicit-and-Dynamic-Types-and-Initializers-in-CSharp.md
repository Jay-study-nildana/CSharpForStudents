## 1. Scope and Purpose

This guide covers the C# language features related to implicit typing (var), dynamic binding (dynamic), concise object and collection initialization, and anonymous types. It is intended as an interview prep and quick reference document for developers, with conceptual explanations, code examples, best practices, pitfalls, and interview-style Q&A.

---

## 2. Quick Version History & When Features Arrived

- C# 3.0 (2007): var (implicit local types), object initializers, collection initializers, anonymous types, LINQ (these features were introduced together).
- C# 4.0 (2010): dynamic (Dynamic Language Runtime integration).
- C# 9.0 (2020): target-typed new improves initializer ergonomics.
- C# 9/10/11+: init-only properties, records (relevant for immutability and initializers).

---

## 3. Overview: Type Systems & Binding in C#

C# is statically typed: types are checked at compile time, providing safety and tooling. However, language features provide convenience layers:

- var: compile-time type inference — the compiler determines a specific static type for the variable. After compilation, var is just a statically typed variable.
- dynamic: bypasses compile-time static type checking for certain operations; binding is deferred until runtime (via DLR). The runtime resolves operations (method calls, properties, indexers).
- object: the base type of the type system — you can store any reference type (and boxed value types) but need casts to access specific members.

Understanding the difference between compile-time inference (var) and runtime binding (dynamic) is crucial.

---

## 4. var — Implicitly Typed Local Variables

### Syntax & Basic Examples
```csharp
var x = 42;               // int
var name = "Alice";       // string
var list = new List<int>(); // List<int>
```

The compiler infers the type from the initializer. var is only allowed for local variables (including in foreach, using declarations, out variables starting C# 7.0, and in deconstruction assignments with explicit declarations).

### Compiler Behavior & Type Inference Rules
- var requires an initializer at the declaration site. The compiler uses the compile-time type of the initializer expression.
- The inferred type is a single concrete type (not "dynamic") — e.g., var x = GetPerson(); the type of x is whatever GetPerson() returns at compile time.
- var cannot be used for fields (class-level) declarations (except in certain contexts like implicitly typed foreach with var in a foreach variable).
- var does not mean "variant" or "dynamic". It is simply syntactic sugar resulting in a statically typed variable.

### When You Cannot Use var
- Without initializer: var x; // error
- When initializer is null without cast: var x = null; // error, ambiguous
- For multiple variable declarators with same var: var a = 1, b = "2"; // error (types differ)
- At field level: public var value = 42; // error

Examples:
```csharp
var x = GetNullable(); // if GetNullable() returns object and could be null, the type is object
var n = (string)null;  // valid, inferred as string
```

### Best Practices & Readability Considerations
- Use var for:
  - When the type is obvious from the initializer: var i = 0; var s = "text";
  - When the type name is long or less important (generic types, LINQ expressions). Example: var customers = new Dictionary<string, List<Order>>();
  - When working with anonymous types, because you cannot name them.
- Prefer explicit type when:
  - The type is not obvious from the right-hand side, use explicit type for readability.
  - For public samples or APIs where clarity is important.
- Team style rules often prefer a mix; follow project conventions.

### var with LINQ and Anonymous Types
```csharp
var q = from c in customers
        select new { c.Id, c.Name };

foreach (var item in q) {
    Console.WriteLine(item.Name);
}
```
Anonymous types require var because their type name is compiler-generated and cannot be spelled.

### Common Pitfalls & Gotchas
- var could hide boxing/unboxing or conversions; always be aware of actual inferred type.
- var with null: var n = null; // compile-time error. You must cast or provide a typed new or default.
- var with ternary expression: var x = condition ? new A() : new B(); // if A and B are unrelated, compile error.
- var with numeric literal: var n = 1; // int, not long — numeric literal types follow usual rules.

---

## 5. dynamic — Dynamic Binding at Runtime

### What dynamic Is and How It Differs from object/var
- dynamic is a static type that tells the compiler to skip compile-time type checking for operations on that expression.
- At runtime, the DLR (Dynamic Language Runtime) resolves members, calls or conversions. If the operation cannot be resolved, a RuntimeBinderException (or other runtime exception) occurs.

Key differences:
- var: compile-time inference, strongly typed after compilation.
- object: static, compile-time; you need casts to access members.
- dynamic: runtime binding, allows calling methods or accessing members without compile-time checks.

### Example
```csharp
dynamic d = 1;
d = d + 2;                 // allowed, resolved at runtime
Console.WriteLine(d.Substring(1)); // runtime: RuntimeBinderException if d is int
```

### How C# Resolves dynamic Operations (DLR)
- The DLR creates call sites with caching. The first call resolves method/operation based on runtime types and emits a fast path for subsequent calls of same shapes (types).
- It supports method invocation, property access, indexers, operators, conversions, and binding to COM objects and dynamic languages.

### Typical Use Cases
- Interop with COM/Office APIs (dynamic avoids verbose COM wrappers).
- Interop with dynamic languages (Python via IronPython, JavaScript engines).
- Working with JSON or loosely typed data (ExpandoObject, JObject).
- Rapid prototyping or DSLs where static types are too restrictive.

Example with ExpandoObject:
```csharp
dynamic expando = new System.Dynamic.ExpandoObject();
expando.Name = "Alice";
expando.Age = 30;
Console.WriteLine(expando.Name);
```

JSON parsing example (Newtonsoft.Json):
```csharp
dynamic obj = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<dynamic>(json);
string name = obj.person.name;
```

### Exceptions and Runtime Errors with dynamic
- Missing member: RuntimeBinderException
- Wrong arity or parameter types: RuntimeBinderException or argument exceptions
- Null reference: NullReferenceException at runtime if null access attempted

### Mixing Static and Dynamic Code
- Once an expression becomes dynamic in an operation, the result is dynamic.
- Example:
  - static object o = Get(); // compile-time object type
  - dynamic d = o; // subsequent calls are dynamic
- You can cast back to static types explicitly:
  ```csharp
  var name = (string)d.Name; // cast from dynamic to string with runtime check
  ```

### Performance & Debugging Considerations
- Dynamic binding has overhead compared to static dispatch: runtime lookup + possibly boxing/unboxing.
- The DLR caches binding results, so repeated calls to same shapes are relatively efficient.
- Debugging dynamic is harder: tooling doesn’t provide compile-time IntelliSense for dynamic members and many runtime errors occur only in execution.

### Security & Safety Notes
- Avoid dynamic for security-sensitive code where unchecked operations could lead to vulnerabilities.
- Validate inputs and perform explicit checks when using dynamic data from untrusted sources.

---

## 6. Object Initializers

Object initializers provide concise syntax to set properties/fields after calling a constructor.

### Basic Syntax
```csharp
var person = new Person { Name = "Alice", Age = 30 };
```

Equivalent to:
```csharp
var tmp = new Person();
tmp.Name = "Alice";
tmp.Age = 30;
```

### Nested Initializers
```csharp
var order = new Order {
    Id = 1,
    Customer = new Customer { Name = "Bob", City = "NY" },
    Items = { new OrderItem { Sku = "A", Qty = 1 } } // only valid if Items is initialized
};
```

### Combining constructors & initializers
```csharp
var p = new Person("id-1") { Name = "Eve", Age = 25 };
```

### init-only properties (C# 9+) and immutability
- With init accessors, you can use object initializers to set properties only at initialization time:
```csharp
public class Person {
    public string Name { get; init; }
    public int Age { get; init; }
}
var p = new Person { Name = "Sam", Age = 28 }; // allowed
p.Name = "Other"; // compile-time error
```

### Use Cases & Mapping
- Mapping between DTOs and domain objects is concise:
```csharp
var dto = new CustomerDto { Id = c.Id, Name = c.Name };
```
- This pattern is common in tests and object creation in code.

### Limitations
- Initializers call property setters; properties without setters can't be assigned unless they have init accessor (C# 9+) or you use constructor parameters.
- Object initializers translate into setter calls; if constructor invariants depend on properties being set before being accessed, avoid using initializers that might violate invariants.

---

## 7. Collection Initializers

Collection initializers let you initialize collections in-line.

### Basic Syntax
```csharp
var list = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4 };
var stack = new Stack<string> { "a", "b" };
```

### Dictionary initialization
```csharp
var dict = new Dictionary<string, int> {
    ["apple"] = 5,
    ["banana"] = 7
};
```
Or pre-C# 6 syntax:
```csharp
var dict = new Dictionary<string, int> {
    { "apple", 5 },
    { "banana", 7 }
};
```

### Compiler Translation
The compiler translates collection initializers into calls to the collection’s Add method (or indexer for dictionary index initializer). The collection type must have an accessible Add method (or be an array/collection that supports initialization).

Example translation:
```csharp
var list = new List<int> { 1, 2 };
// becomes:
var temp = new List<int>();
temp.Add(1);
temp.Add(2);
list = temp;
```

### Nested & Complex Collection Initializers
```csharp
var customers = new List<Customer> {
    new Customer { Name = "A", Orders = { new Order{Id=1}, new Order{Id=2} } },
    new Customer { Name = "B" }
};
```
Note: inner collection initializers rely on the property being a non-null collection (initialized in constructor or property initializer).

### Target-typed new (C# 9+) & initializers
```csharp
List<int> numbers = new() { 1, 2, 3 }; // compiler infers type for new
```

### Limitations & Requirements
- The Add method must be accessible and have compatible overload(s).
- For keyed initializers (dictionary), the compiler must find an Add(TKey, TValue) method or accept index initializer (C# 6's index initialization).

---

## 8. Anonymous Types

### Syntax & Basic Example
Anonymous types let you quickly create an immutable type with read-only properties without declaring a named type:
```csharp
var anon = new { Id = 1, Name = "Alice" };
Console.WriteLine(anon.Name); // "Alice"
```

Key points:
- Property names and types are inferred from the initializer expressions.
- Anonymous types are compiler-generated sealed classes with read-only properties and overridden Equals/GetHashCode/ToString.

### Equality, Immutability, ToString
- Anonymous types implement value-based equality: two anonymous instances of the same anonymous type are equal if all properties equal (using Equals).
- ToString generates a human-readable listing of properties and values.

Example:
```csharp
var a = new { X = 1, Y = 2 };
var b = new { X = 1, Y = 2 };
bool eq = a.Equals(b); // true
```

### Typical Use Cases
- LINQ projections:
```csharp
var q = people.Select(p => new { p.Id, p.FullName });
```
- Quick DTOs in tests and local transformations.

### Limitations
- Anonymous types are local to the assembly and cannot be used as method return types directly in a strongly typed way — you can only return them as object or dynamic, or use generic helpers.
- Anonymous types across different assemblies or methods with different property ordering are different types.
- You cannot declare a method with an anonymous type parameter or return type in signature — except via var/dynamic/object or generics with type inference inside the same method.

Workarounds:
- Use tuples (ValueTuple) if the shape is simple and you need to return data: (int Id, string Name).
- Create a small named DTO class for public APIs.

### Use with var & LINQ
Anonymous types are often captured in var:
```csharp
var projection = people.Select(p => new { p.Id, p.Name }).ToList();
```

### Reflection on Anonymous Types
- Anonymous types have names like "<>f__AnonymousType0`2" and are decorated with CompilerGeneratedAttribute.
- You can inspect properties with reflection:
```csharp
var props = anon.GetType().GetProperties();
```

---

## 9. Interplay Between These Features

- var is required for anonymous types — you cannot write the anonymous type name.
- object initializers are commonly used with var when creating complex objects.
- collection initializers and object initializers often appear together:
```csharp
var catalog = new Catalog {
    Name = "X",
    Products = { new Product { Sku = "A" }, new Product { Sku = "B" } }
};
```
- dynamic can hold objects constructed via object or collection initializers or anonymous types — but be mindful that if you pass anonymous type to dynamic and then try to access its properties later, binding happens at runtime and may succeed if the runtime type still has those properties.

Example mixing:
```csharp
var anon = new { Name = "Z", Items = new[] { 1,2,3 } };
dynamic d = anon;
Console.WriteLine(d.Name); // runtime binding used, OK since property exists
```

---

## 10. Performance Considerations and Memory Behavior

- var: No runtime cost; it's compile-time only.
- dynamic:
  - Has runtime cost due to DLR binding, creating call sites, and possibly boxing/unboxing.
  - Repeated dynamic calls on same call site are optimized via caching.
  - Use where flexibility outweighs cost or for interop scenarios.
- Object and collection initializers:
  - They are syntactic sugar compiling to constructor + setter/Add calls; no extra runtime allocations besides what those calls normally do.
  - For nested initializers, inner constructors and Add calls allocate as usual.
- Anonymous types:
  - Compiler generates classes; each anonymous type is a real class; each instance is allocated on the heap (like any reference type). Use in large hot loops judiciously.
  - Anonymous types override Equals/GetHashCode — cost for equality comparisons; useful for hashing scenarios but consider overhead.
- For high-performance scenarios:
  - Prefer value types or pooling where allocation pressure matters.
  - Avoid dynamic in hot paths.
  - Avoid creating many short-lived anonymous objects in tight loops unneededly.

---

## 11. Design and API Guidelines / Best Practices

- Use var when it improves readability and the type is obvious; avoid var where type is not clear.
- Prefer explicit types for public API signatures; do not use var for fields or return types.
- Avoid dynamic unless necessary — prefer strong typing, generics, or well-defined interfaces.
- Use object initializers and collection initializers for clear, concise object creation, especially in tests and DTOs.
- Prefer init-only properties (C# 9+) and records for immutable data models rather than anonymous types for public models.
- For LINQ projections that are used only locally, anonymous types with var are appropriate. For cross-method data, use tuples or named types.
- When exposing collections from APIs, prefer interfaces (IReadOnlyList<T>, IEnumerable<T>) and return read-only wrappers or copies to avoid accidental mutation.

---

## 12. Common Mistakes & Anti-Patterns

- Using var everywhere (reduces clarity).
- Using dynamic for everything (loses compile-time safety).
- Returning anonymous types from methods by casting to object and expecting callers to use them in a typed way.
- Relying on object initializers to set state needed in constructors (breaks invariants).
- Modifying collection during iteration — unrelated to these features but often seen with collection initializers assumed to prevent modifications.
- Using anonymous types for public API shapes — break binary compatibility and reduce clarity.

---

## 13. Testing and Debugging Tips

- Debugging var: hover in IDE to inspect inferred type; use explicit type if unclear.
- Debugging dynamic:
  - Set breakpoints and inspect the runtime type (d.GetType()).
  - Use exception settings to break on RuntimeBinderException.
  - Add explicit type checks or casts for critical sections to force earlier errors.
- For object initializers, step through constructor and initializer assignments if you expect side effects.
- For anonymous types, inspect properties in debugger; they are compiler-generated types and have readable property names.
- Unit tests:
  - Validate mapping code that uses object initializers.
  - For dynamic callers, test failure scenarios to catch runtime binding errors.
  - Use integration tests for interop scenarios (COM/JSON) relying on dynamic behavior.

---

## 14. Comprehensive Q&A — Developer & Interview Questions (with answers)

Q1: What is the difference between var and dynamic?  
A: var is compile-time type inference. After compilation, the variable has a concrete static type determined by the compiler. dynamic defers binding to runtime — operations on dynamic expressions are resolved at runtime via the DLR, and errors surface at execution.

Q2: Can you use var for fields or method return types?  
A: No — var is only for local variable declarations (including foreach loop variables and out variable declarations in recent C# versions). You cannot use var for fields or explicit method return types.

Q3: When should you prefer var?  
A: Use var when the type is obvious from the initializer (var stream = new FileStream(...)) or the type name is verbose. Avoid var when it hides essential type information.

Q4: Why was dynamic added to C#? Give practical uses.  
A: dynamic was added to better support dynamic language interop, COM interop, and scenarios where the structure is not known until runtime (e.g., JSON documents, dynamic scripting). It simplifies code calling dynamic objects without lots of reflection or verbose casting.

Q5: How are object initializers compiled?  
A: The compiler generates code that calls the parameterless constructor (or specified constructor), followed by setter calls for each initializer. For collection initializers, it generates calls to Add (or uses indexer syntax mapping).

Q6: Can you use object initializer with read-only properties?  
A: Not with traditional readonly properties (no setter). With init-only properties (C# 9+), you can set them in initializers but they become immutable after initialization.

Q7: Are anonymous types mutable?  
A: No — properties on anonymous types are read-only (get-only) and the anonymous type is logically immutable.

Q8: How do you return anonymous type from a method?  
A: You cannot return an anonymous type in a strongly-typed way. Options: return object (loses compile-time typing), return dynamic, return a tuple or named type, or use generics with caller-provided selector (e.g., returning IQueryable<T> or using projection functions).

Q9: What happens if you assign null to var?  
A: You must give var an initializer with a known type. var x = null; // compile error. You can cast: var x = (string)null; // inferred as string.

Q10: How do collection initializers work with dictionaries that have complex Add signature?  
A: Compiler looks for an Add method and will match the initializer form { key, value } to Add(key, value). With index initializers (C# 6+), you can use ["key"] = value syntax.

Q11: Is dynamic just object under the hood?  
A: dynamic is represented in metadata as System.Object, but the compiler emits special dynamic call sites and the DLR resolves operations at runtime. The runtime type is still the actual object type; dynamic controls binding rules.

Q12: What is ExpandoObject?  
A: ExpandoObject implements IDynamicMetaObjectProvider and allows adding/removing members at runtime. It's a common dynamic container for flexible data.

Q13: How are anonymous types equality and GetHashCode implemented?  
A: The compiler generates Equals and GetHashCode based on the values of the properties in declaration order (value equality semantics).

Q14: When should you avoid dynamic in APIs?  
A: Avoid dynamic in public APIs where consumers expect compile-time guarantees. dynamic is also not ideal for high-performance paths.

Q15: How to debug runtime binding errors from dynamic?  
A: Catch RuntimeBinderException, inspect the runtime types, and add logging or unit tests replicating the dynamic usage. Prefer static typing where possible.

Q16: Can you use collection initializers with your own types?  
A: Yes — the type must expose an Add method with compatible signatures to accept initializer entries.

Q17: Are anonymous types serializable?  
A: Anonymous types are not guaranteed to be serializable across process boundaries or to be stable across assembly versions. For serialization, prefer DTO classes.

Q18: Explain target-typed new in relation to initializers.  
A: With target-typed new, you can omit the generic/explicit type on the right-hand side: List<int> l = new() { 1, 2, 3 }; The compiler infers the type from the left side.

Q19: How do you handle JSON that has dynamic structure?  
A: Options:
  - Deserialize to dynamic (Json.NET returns JToken/JObject) and use dynamic or indexers.
  - Use typed models with optional properties.
  - Use System.Text.Json with JsonElement for low-level access.
  - Use ExpandoObject for a dynamic container.

Q20: What does the compiler do when you initialize a collection property via nested initializer but property is null?  
A: If the property is null (not initialized by constructor or inline property initializer), nested initializers that call Add will throw NullReferenceException at runtime. Ensure the property is non-null first.

## 15. Practical Exercises & Projects

1. Basic:
   - Create a class Person and initialize instances using object initializers (with and without constructors). Experiment with init-only properties.
   - Create collections of Person using collection initializers and target-typed new.

2. Intermediate:
   - Write a LINQ query that projects into an anonymous type and groups results. Use var in loops to process the projection.
   - Deserialize a JSON payload into dynamic using Newtonsoft.Json and safely read properties with null checks and try/catch for runtime binder exceptions.

3. Advanced:
   - Implement an interop wrapper using dynamic for a COM object and compare code before/after dynamic usage (reflection vs dynamic).
   - Write a small library that accepts an IEnumerable<dynamic> and performs operations. Add unit tests verifying behavior when fields are missing (use ExpandoObject and JObject).
   - Build a mapping utility that uses object initializers to map from DTO to domain objects and compare with AutoMapper in terms of clarity and performance.

4. Testing:
   - Unit test functions that return anonymous types using Assert with reflection or converting to tuples.
   - Write tests to ensure collection initializers call Add as expected (use a test collection that records Add calls).
