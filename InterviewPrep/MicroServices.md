## 1. What are Microservices?

**Microservices** is an architectural style where applications are structured as a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable services.  
- Each service encapsulates a specific business capability.
- Services communicate over lightweight protocols (typically HTTP or messaging).

---

## 2. Microservices Architecture

- **Service:** Independent, single-responsibility unit (e.g., Orders, Payments, Users).
- **API Gateway:** Entry point for clients; routes requests to appropriate services.
- **Centralized Logging & Monitoring:** Collect logs and metrics from all services.
- **Service Registry/Discovery:** Enables dynamic lookup of service endpoints.

**Diagram:**  
```
[Client] ---> [API Gateway] ---> [Service A]
                                   [Service B]
                                   [Service C]
```

## 3. Benefits & Challenges

**Benefits:**
- Independent deployment & scaling
- Technology flexibility per service (.NET, Node.js, etc.)
- Fault isolation
- Agile development (small, focused teams)

**Challenges:**
- Distributed systems complexity
- Data consistency and transactions
- Network latency and failure handling
- Monitoring & tracing across services

---

## 4. .NET Technologies for Microservices

- **ASP.NET Core:** Build lightweight RESTful APIs.
- **gRPC:** High-performance, strongly-typed RPC framework.
- **MassTransit, NServiceBus:** For message-based communication.
- **Ocelot:** .NET API Gateway.
- **Docker:** Containerize each service.
- **Kubernetes/Azure Container Apps:** Orchestrate deployment & scaling.
- **Entity Framework Core:** ORM for data access.

---

## 5. Project Structure

```
/MicroservicesSolution
  /OrderService
    /OrderService.API
    /OrderService.Domain
    /OrderService.Infrastructure
  /PaymentService
    ...
  /ProductService
    ...
  /ApiGateway
    ...
  /Shared
    /SharedKernel
```
- Each service is a separate .NET project (solution folder or repo).
- Shared code (DTOs, contracts) goes into `SharedKernel`.

---

## 6. Communication Between Microservices

**Synchronous:**  
- REST APIs (HTTP)
- gRPC

**Asynchronous:**  
- Message Brokers (RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus, Kafka)
- Event-driven communication

**Example (.NET REST API):**
```csharp
// Using HttpClient to call another microservice
var response = await httpClient.GetAsync("http://products/api/products/1");
```

---

## 7. API Gateway & Service Discovery

- **API Gateway:** Handles routing, authentication, rate limiting, aggregation.
  - Example: Ocelot for .NET
- **Service Discovery:** Dynamic endpoint management (e.g., Consul, Eureka, Kubernetes DNS).

---

## 8. Data Management in Microservices

- **Database per Service:** Each service owns its data (polyglot persistence).
- **No shared database between services.**
- **Data consistency:** Use eventual consistency, Saga pattern for complex transactions.
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):** Separate read/write models for scalability.

---

## 9. Security Considerations

- **Authentication/Authorization:** Centralized at API Gateway or per service (JWT, OAuth2).
- **Transport security:** Use HTTPS everywhere.
- **Service-to-service security:** Mutual TLS, API keys.
- **Least privilege:** Minimize access between services.

---

## 10. Testing Strategies

- **Unit Testing:** Test business logic in isolation.
- **Integration Testing:** Test service interactions with dependencies.
- **Contract Testing:** Ensure API compatibility between services.
- **End-to-End Testing:** Test workflows across multiple services.

---

## 11. Deployment & Scaling

- **Containers:** Use Docker for packaging services.
- **Orchestration:** Use Kubernetes, Docker Compose, or Azure Container Apps.
- **CI/CD:** Automated build, test, deploy pipelines (GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps).
- **Rolling upgrades & blue-green deployments:** Minimize downtime.

## 12. Common Microservices Interview Questions & Answers

**Q1: What are microservices and how are they different from monolithic architecture?**  
> Microservices are small, independent services that communicate over the network. Monolithic architecture is a single, large codebase where all components are tightly coupled. Microservices offer better scalability, fault isolation, and enable independent deployments.

**Q2: How do microservices communicate?**  
> Microservices communicate synchronously via REST/gRPC or asynchronously via message brokers (e.g., RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus).

**Q3: Why should each microservice have its own database?**  
> To ensure loose coupling, autonomy, and independent scaling. Shared databases can cause tight coupling and deployment bottlenecks.

**Q4: What is the API Gateway pattern?**  
> An API Gateway is a single entry point for clients, handling routing, authentication, rate limiting, and aggregation of responses from multiple services.

**Q5: What is eventual consistency and how is it addressed in microservices?**  
> Eventual consistency means data changes propagate over time. Use event-driven messaging and patterns like Saga to coordinate distributed transactions.

**Q6: How do you handle authentication in a microservices architecture?**  
> Use JWT/OAuth2 tokens, typically validated at the API Gateway. Services can also validate tokens internally as needed.

**Q7: What is the Saga pattern?**  
> A Saga is a sequence of local transactions, coordinated using events or compensation logic, used to manage distributed transactions across services.

**Q8: How do you monitor and log microservices?**  
> Use centralized logging (ELK, Azure Monitor), distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry, Application Insights), and health checks for each service.

**Q9: How do you deploy and scale microservices?**  
> Containerize services with Docker, orchestrate with Kubernetes or Azure Container Apps, and use CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment.

**Q10: What are some challenges with microservices?**  
> Complexity in distributed systems, network latency, data consistency, service discovery, monitoring, and debugging across services.

## 13. Best Practices

- Keep services loosely coupled and focused on a single business capability.
- Use API gateway for external access and routing.
- Containerize all services.
- Automate build, test, and deployment pipelines.
- Use health checks and centralized monitoring/logging.
- Ensure each service has its own datastore.
- Prefer asynchronous communication for scalability.
- Secure service communication and data.
- Apply versioning to service APIs.

**Practical Exercise:**

1. Create two simple ASP.NET Core Web API projects (e.g., Products and Orders).
2. Containerize each with Docker.
3. Use HttpClient in Orders to call Products API.
4. Set up Ocelot API Gateway to route requests.
5. Implement health checks and logging.
6. Deploy locally with Docker Compose or to Azure Container Apps.
7. Secure APIs with JWT authentication.
