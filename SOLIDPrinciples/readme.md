Some example code related to SOLID Principles.

# Projects

1. [SOLID-principles-harrymt-original-untouched](SOLID-principles-harrymt-original-untouched) - SOLID code from harry mt.
1. [SOLID-principles-harrymt-modified](SOLID-principles-harrymt-modified) - SOLID code from harry mt with my own comments and explanations.

Note 1 : The harrymt files were created in a older version of visual studio I think. So, expect some visual studio install/updates before you can run them.
