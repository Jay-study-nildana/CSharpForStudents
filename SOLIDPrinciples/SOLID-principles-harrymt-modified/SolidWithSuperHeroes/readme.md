# SOLID Principles with Batman Example

I decided to discuss SOLID principles using Batman as an example.

Look at specific files here, for specific examples.

1. [The single-responsibility principle](SinSOLID.cs)
1. [The openâ€“closed principle](OinSOLID.cs)
1. [The Liskov substitution principle](LinSOLID.cs)
1. [The interface segregation principle](IinSOLID.cs)

As usual, each file has plenty of comments for you to learn.
