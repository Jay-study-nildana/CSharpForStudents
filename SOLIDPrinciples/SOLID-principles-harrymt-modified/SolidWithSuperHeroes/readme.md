# SOLID Principles with Batman Example

I decided to discuss SOLID principles using Batman as an example.

Look at specific files here, for specific examples.

1. [The single-responsibility principle](SinSOLID.cs)
1. [The openâ€“closed principle](OinSOLID.cs)
1. [The Liskov substitution principle](LinSOLID.cs)
1. [The interface segregation principle](IinSOLID.cs)
1. [The dependency inversion principle](DinSOLID.cs)

As usual, each file has plenty of comments for you to learn.

## Additional Notes

### SinSOLID.cs
**Principle:** Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)  
**Summary:**  
Demonstrates how a class should have only one reason to change, focusing on a single responsibility or functionality.

### OinSOLID.cs
**Principle:** Open/Closed Principle (OCP)  
**Summary:**  
Shows how classes should be open for extension but closed for modification, typically using inheritance or interfaces to add new behavior without altering existing code.

### LinSOLID.cs
**Principle:** Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)  
**Summary:**  
Illustrates that derived classes should be substitutable for their base classes without affecting the correctness of the program, often using polymorphism.

### IinSOLID.cs
**Principle:** Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)  
**Summary:**  
Highlights the importance of splitting large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones so that clients only need to implement methods they actually use.

### DinSOLID.cs
**Principle:** Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)  
**Summary:**  
Shows how high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but both should depend on abstractions (interfaces). Uses a Batman example to illustrate dependency injection and flexible design.
