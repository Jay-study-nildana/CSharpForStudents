# AzFunctionHWJan282025

This project is an Azure Function application built using .NET 8.0. It demonstrates the use of various Microsoft.Extensions libraries for configuration, logging, and dependency injection.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
- [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local)

### Setup

2. Restore the dependencies:
    ```sh
    dotnet restore
    ```

3. Build the project:
    ```sh
    dotnet build
    ```

### Running the Function Locally

1. Start the Azure Functions runtime:
    ```sh
    func start
    ```

2. The function should now be running locally. You can test it using tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [curl](https://curl.se/).
