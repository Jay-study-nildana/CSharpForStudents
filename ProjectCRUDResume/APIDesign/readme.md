# design drawings

As I keep learning new things, I want to ensure consistency in the apps I build, and the API servers that power these apps.

This folder contains the API designs that will designed and followed in all our API servers.

# core idea and purpose

as I type this, I am planning to build and maintain three API servers, at least. 

- ASP DOT NET
- ASP DOT NET CORE
- NODE JS 

I want to ensure they are all identical, so I can replicate and reuse ideas, content, resources and so on. 

If I keep building different APIs on each platform, I will lose my mind, eventually.
