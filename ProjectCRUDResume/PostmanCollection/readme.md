# Postman Documentation

There are multiple postman collections above. You might be wondering which one to use. In most cases, there will be date associated with each postman collection. Use the one with the latest date (for example - Complete Collection - October 14th ) and you should be good to go.

# variables

I use variables to update the host (root domain of the API server). This is usefull if you are hosting API on your own server or on the local host (where the port number might be different).

Further, I also use variables for token. That way, you can update the token once and it becomes available in all the endpoints in the collection.
