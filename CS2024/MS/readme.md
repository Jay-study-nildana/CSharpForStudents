# Revisiting C Sharp 2024 Edition - Projects and Micro Services

So, I decided to update my knowledge for my students in 2024. This is that code.

# 2024 Onwards

Plenty of large projects and micro services, ideal for applying all the learnt programming concepts, will come here. In all solutions (and projects in them), I have followed 'Micro Services' architecture.

1. [APIProjectFeb202024](APIProjectFeb202024) - A simple API Project with a web app consuming consuming this API. Using the Micro Service Architecture as promised.
1. [Mango-TillSection5](Mango-TillSection5) - Microsoft Services Project with a back end API, Authentication API server with Roles and a simple .NET Razor Pages MVC app that consumes both the backend API and the Authentication API Server. 

# Pre 2024

These are some projects that I had built prior to the big 2024 revamp.

1. [Consuming3rdPartyAPI](Consuming3rdPartyAPI) - make simple GET requests, use QuickType and use RestSharp
1. [EntityFrameWorkDemo](EntityFrameWorkDemo) - using Entity Framework with SQLite, MS Sql Server and so on.
