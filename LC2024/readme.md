# Leet Code Practie

Some students are asking me, "Jay sir, what is your leet code rank or score? How come you are not on that website?". So, I was like, okay, around March 2024, purchased the premium annual plan and just jumped in.

1. Here are my solutions. I have added detailed comments, neccessary links as usual.
1. see my [leetcode profile](https://leetcode.com/vijayasimhabr/)
1. As usual, I have blogged about. [Read my 'coding test' journey, here](https://vijayasimhabr.medium.com/list/coding-tests-and-such-7a6efbf0ebc0).

# Visual Studio Solutions - First Run

These are solutions from my beginner days of LeetCode. Hopefully, once I finish all the solutions, I will do them again, and hope to write more improved code.
