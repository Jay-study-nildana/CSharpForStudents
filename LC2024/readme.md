# Leet Code Practie

Some students are asking me, "Jay sir, what is your leet code rank or score? How come you are not on that website?". So, I was like, okay, around March 2024, purchased the premium annual plan and just jumped in.

1. Here are my solutions. I have added detailed comments, neccessary links as usual.
1. see my [leetcode profile](https://leetcode.com/vijayasimhabr/)
1. As usual, I have blogged about. [Read my 'coding test' journey, here](https://vijayasimhabr.medium.com/list/coding-tests-and-such-7a6efbf0ebc0).
1. I am tracking my LeetCode rank as it (hopefull) improves over time. [see the rank with dates, here]()

# Visual Studio Solutions - First Run - March 14th Onwards

These are solutions from my beginner days of LeetCode. After a few months, hopefully my coding skills have improved, and I will do them again, which will become my second run (scroll down to the next section).

# Visual Studio Solutions - Second Run - insert date when you begin

TODO. Do all the solutions again, but, make them faster and less memory consuming.

This is where I plan to do all the puzzles again, perhaps after I have gained some more coding skills.

1. as of now nothing.

# hire and get to know me

find ways to hire me, follow me and stay in touch with me.
