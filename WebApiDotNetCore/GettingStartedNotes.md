# Quick Notes

1. If you are using VS Code, then you can switch between SDK versions by using the global json file. See here for more details - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42077229/switch-between-dotnet-core-sdk-versions
1. On VS Code, you must install the extension for C# Omnisharp to do debugging. 
1. On loading project, 'Debug Assets' will get added. Let it happen. Otherwise, you wont be able to debug.
1. The, just hit Run > Start Debugging and its good to go.
1. If OmniSharp gives you a error about mismatched SDK version, just change the global json file to match the currently debugged project version. Easy. 
1. When adding packages, always specify the version number.
