# .NET Core 5.0 Project - Consume Web API with JavaScript

In this quick demo, showing how to consume the API. 

Code Borrowed from project - WebApiDotNetCore5point1SQLite. Check that project for web api details.

1. Tested on VS Code on Mac
1. The web app is served at https://localhost:5001/
1. Remember to open developer tools so you see responses and calls that happen after every operation
1. Specifically focus on the requests and responses that deal in JSON, after interacting with the local API data.
1. Compare this developer tools information with response you are getting in Postman and also by browsing data direclty in SQLite Browser.
1. Also, remember that, when building a proper web app, it is recommended to use a more advanced library like React JS.
1. Also, remember that you will need to learn Bootstrap, if you have plans to become a proper front end web developer.
1. You dont need to build your web app inside dot net. You can build it separately and make it talk to your API server.
