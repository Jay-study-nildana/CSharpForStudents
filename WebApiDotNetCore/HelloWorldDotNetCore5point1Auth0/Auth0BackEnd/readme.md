# .NET Core 5.0 Project - Auth0 Back End

This is the backend API part of the API server. In this project, the focus is on linking or configuring or attaching the Auth0 provided OAuth2 server with our API server which is built using .NET.

Please check the file [SequenceOfSteps.md](SequenceOfSteps.md) for the specific steps you have to do to make this work. It's very essential you do it this way because, configuring a OAuth2 is a fairly complicated task.

Remember that authorization is also called as scopes also called as policy. These terms are used interchangeably.

Please check [TokenTestingAPI.md](TokenTestingAPI.md) after you have configured your API and test it.

Also check [EnableCORS.md](EnableCORS.md) to enable CORS. This is mandatory because, your web app client, needs CORS enabled.

# Advanced Configuration
