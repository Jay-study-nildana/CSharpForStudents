# .NET Core 5.0 Project - Auth0 Demo

This project deals with Authenticating and Authorizing The Web Api. 

Authentication - This is about getting tokens.
Authorization - This is about roles and permissions and scopes after authentication. Like Admin Role, User Role, Guest Role.

In this folder, has the following projects.

1. [Auth0BackEnd](Auth0BackEnd) - API Server with Auth0 based Authentication and Authorization
1. [Auth0JavaScriptApp](Auth0JavaScriptApp) - Web App built using JS which consumes with API Server. 

A developer who builts a web api should also have the bare minimum knowledge to build a basic web app client that consumes the api server. Hence, in this project, I have included both the API server and React JS App.
