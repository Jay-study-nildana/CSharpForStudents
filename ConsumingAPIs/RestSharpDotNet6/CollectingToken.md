# Collecting Token

So, right now, there is no way to automatically collect a token from Auth0. 

So, here is how I usually get my token.

1. Visit my React JS App. (check links below)
1. Login as usual.
1. After that, check the developer tools in firefox browser. Under network calls, one of them will have the JSON for the token response.
1. Now, just grab the token from that. 

That's it, you are all set.
