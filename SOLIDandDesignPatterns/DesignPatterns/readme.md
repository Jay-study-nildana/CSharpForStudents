# Design Patterns

This repo shows all the design patterns.

# Dependency on SOLIDDesignPrinciples

I have another project called SOLIDDesignPrinciples.

That project contains illustrated code related to the SOLID principles of programming. 

It also contains a lot of stuff that I want to reuse in this project. So, I have included it here to avoid having to recreate/recode them here. 

At the same time, it creates a dependency on that project. However, I expect any discussion on Design Patterns (for example, when I am taking a class) to include a discussion on SOLID principles. So, I will risk this dependency. At the same time, this also acts a self-test if I am incorporating all these principles and concepts properly. If I have written the code correctly, that means, there should be no breaking changes any where.
