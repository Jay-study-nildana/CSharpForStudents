# SOLID Design Principles

This repo shows demo code for SOLID Design Priciples in C#

# Required for Design Patterns project

This project is needed for Design Patterns project code. The Design Patterns project uses the classes, helper methods, interfaces and related things available in this SOLID project. 

However, as of now, Design Patterns does not depend on the Design Pattern Project. So, it is a one way relationship from Design Pattern to this.
