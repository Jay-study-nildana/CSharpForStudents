# December 19th 2020

Got busy with paid projects. Now, the volume of work is coming down, and because of Christmas, there may not be much work. 

So, lets get back to this. 

Next

Study and Read the full section of Structural Patterns.

make notes..and when you feel comfortable, begin the coding.

Structural Patterns.



# November 15th 2020

Okay, lets see what is next. 

Next is Prototyping. 

This is mainly about copying objects so we can reusing them and only make alterations 
when required. 

Alright, that was done. 

Next

Okay, its singleton. 

Actualy, I am not going to do singleton right now. 

"Singletons are not totally evil but, when used carelessly, they will mess up the testability and refactorability of your application. If you really must use a Singleton, try to avoid using it directly (as in, writing SomeComponent.Instance.Foo()) and instead keep specifying it as a dependency (e.g., a constructor argument) where all dependencies are satisfied from a single location in your application (e.g., an IoC container)."

So, for SingleTon, we need to learn Inversion of Control Container aka IOC Container.

# November 11th 2020

alright, lets resume this man. 

Okay Factory pattern done. 

# November 10th 2020

Looks i forgot to update the work diary. 

Okay, SOLID is done.

have begun working on design patterns. 

now doing creation patterns.

Okay, builder pattern is done. 

Next

Factory Pattern

# November 8th 2020

Okay, lets continue. 

Liskov Substitution Principle

LiskovSubstitutionPrinciple

Okay, this is done. 

Next,

Interface Segregation Principle

InterfaceSegregationPrinciple

Okay, this is done.

Next, 

Dependency Inversion Principle

DependencyInversionPrinciple

Okay, lets take a break.

Okay back in action.

Okay, this is also done.

That means, SOLID is done.

I have created a project for design patterns.

I have included SOLID visual studio project code in design patterns so I can reuse the monkey stuff.

Next

Design Patterns

Creational Patterns

# November 7th 2020

Okay man, today, I digged into Open-Closed Principle

Next 

Liskov Substitution Principle

# November 6th 2020

Okay man, I want to do this as per the plan. 

Working on SOLID principles.

Okay SOLIDDesignPrinciples code is done. 

Next resume with 

Open-Closed Principle
