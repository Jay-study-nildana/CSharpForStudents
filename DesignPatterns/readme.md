# Design Patterns

Design patterns are reusable solutions for common problems in software design. They complement the SOLID principles beautifully and provide practical examples of how to write clean, maintainable, and scalable code.

benefits:

1. **Problem-Solving**: Patterns teach them different ways to tackle recurring challenges in software development.
1. **Scalability and Flexibility**: Patterns show how to write extensible and reusable code.
1. **Alignment with SOLID Principles**: Many design patterns naturally adhere to SOLID principles, reinforcing their understanding.

## Essential Design Patterns

Here are some patterns that align well with SOLID principles and are beginner-friendly:

### 1. **Creational Patterns** (Focus on Object Creation)
   - **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance (e.g., Logging service or Configuration manager).
   - **Factory Method**: Provides an interface for creating objects without specifying their concrete classes.
   - **Builder**: Constructs complex objects step by step (e.g., assembling a Report or UI component).

### 2. **Structural Patterns** (Focus on Object Composition)
   - **Adapter**: Converts one interface into another that the client expects (e.g., adapting a legacy API to a modern one).
   - **Decorator**: Adds functionality to an object dynamically (e.g., enhancing a basic notification system with SMS, email, or push notifications).
   - **Facade**: Simplifies the interface for a complex subsystem (e.g., wrapping a library with a simpler API).

### 3. **Behavioral Patterns** (Focus on Object Interaction)
   - **Observer**: Establishes a subscription mechanism to notify multiple observers about changes (e.g., event listeners).
   - **Strategy**: Defines a family of algorithms and lets them be interchangeable (e.g., different sorting algorithms or payment methods).
   - **Command**: Encapsulates a request as an object (e.g., undo/redo functionality in an editor).
