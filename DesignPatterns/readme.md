# Design Patterns

Design Pattern demos for my students.

TODO. Add more design patterns.

# Important Note

I am sharing some projects, class libraries across projects. So, the entire folder needs to be kept as they are whilst using the solutions individually.

# Superman and Batman and Comic Book stuff

I have used super heroes stuff to illustrate the design patterns. I grew up reading comic books. 

Hopefully, that's okay.

# Projects and Solutions

1. [AdapterPattern](AdapterPattern)

# Class Libraries

I use a number of class libraries so I can reuse classes across different solutions.

1. [Batman](Batman)
1. [BatmanVillains](BatmanVillains)
1. [HeroesGeneric](HeroesGeneric)
1. [Superman](Superman)
1. [SupermanVillains](SupermanVillains)
