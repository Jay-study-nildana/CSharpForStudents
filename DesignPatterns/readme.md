# Design Patterns

Design Pattern demos for my students.

# Important Note

I am sharing some projects, class libraries across projects. So, the entire folder needs to be kept as they are whilst using the solutions individually.

# Superman and Batman and Comic Book stuff

I have used super heroes stuff to illustrate the design patterns. I grew up reading comic books. 

Hopefully, that's okay.
